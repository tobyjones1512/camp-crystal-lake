## About

Friday the 13th: The Game shut down its official servers in 2024, taking the game offline on every platform. Other community servers exist on PC, but for PlayStation there wasn't one. The [Camp Crystal Lake](https://discord.gg/dn4pacGHe3) server went live on January 25, 2026 as the first proper PlayStation revival, standing on top of years of community protocol work.

`ccl-server` is the standalone counterpart -- a lighter version anyone can run at home for their own friends.

## Status

Early scaffolding. First release targeted for **July 2026**. In the meantime, play on the main [Camp Crystal Lake](https://discord.gg/dn4pacGHe3) community server.

## Install

Once released, grab a prebuilt binary or installer from the [Releases](https://github.com/CampCrystalLake/ccl-server/releases) page. Linux and Windows builds are published for every tagged release with SHA256 checksums and VirusTotal scans in the release notes.

```sh
# Linux / one-liner
curl -LsSf https://github.com/CampCrystalLake/ccl-server/releases/latest/download/ccl-server-installer.sh | sh

# Windows (PowerShell)
powershell -c "irm https://github.com/CampCrystalLake/ccl-server/releases/latest/download/ccl-server-installer.ps1 | iex"

# Windows MSI

### macOS (Apple container)

On Apple silicon Macs running macOS 26, run the server in a container with Apple's [`container`](https://github.com/apple/container) tool:

```sh
scripts/apple-container.sh start
```

See [docs/apple-container.md](docs/apple-container.md) for the full guide.
